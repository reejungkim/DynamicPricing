<b>Dynamic pricing can be used in various price setting methods.</b>

Three of the most common methods are cost-based, competitor-based, and demand-based.
- Cost-based pricing “adjusts prices dynamically according to business costs and keeps profit margins on a certain level.”
- Competitor-based pricing takes into account competitor pricing decisions.
- Demand-based pricing speaks for itself: Prices increase with growing consumer demand and dwindling supply, and vice versa.



<b>Which industries use dynamic pricing?</b>

Airlines, Hospitality, e-Commerce, Car Rentals, etc.
Algorithms calculate the loyalty level of each customer and set the price lower if a person is a newcomer.
